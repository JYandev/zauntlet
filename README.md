# zauntlet
Zelda/Gauntlet Clone built with PyGame. Made in under a day by team "I Have No Preference Nor Idea" for the Hack-112 Hackathon.

## Story
You are the Wizard and you need food badly. When you are this hungry, no monster can stand between you and the fabled Food of Yendor - a food said to provide infinite sustinance for powerful wizards.

Use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot fireballs. Defeat monsters, navigate the dungeon, and get the food!

## How to Run
Prerequisites are:
* Python 3+
* PyGame 1.9.3 (Installation instructions included below)

Instructions:
  1. Clone this repository (or download and extract the zip)
  2. In a command line, `cd` into the root folder of Zauntlet.
  3. Make sure you have PyGame installed. If not, run `pip install pygame==1.9.3` to get the version we used.
  4. Run `python main.py` and get that food!
